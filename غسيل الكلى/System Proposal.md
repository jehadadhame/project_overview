# System Proposal

## **1. Executive Summary**

This project aims to design and implement a Kidney Dialysis Patient Management System to streamline patient care for individuals with chronic kidney disease. The system will help manage 
what ?
- dialysis sessions, 
- patient appointments, 
- prescriptions, 
- dietary recommendations
- doctor-patient interactions to ensure timely healthcare delivery and patient safety.

---
## **2. Problem Statement**

Managing kidney dialysis patients requires frequent medical _**monitoring**_ and multiple interactions between doctors,_dialysis units_, pharmacies, and nutritionists. Manual scheduling and record-keeping often lead to inefficiencies, delays, and errors, which can negatively affect patient care.

### **Key Issues:**

- Manual and fragmented data management.
- Scheduling conflicts for dialysis and appointments.
- Delayed medication prescriptions and dietary updates.
- Poor communication between healthcare providers and patients.

## **3. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of the system are:

1. **Appointment Management:** Enable automated scheduling for dialysis and doctor appointments.
2. **Medical Record Keeping:** Maintain accurate patient history, including prescriptions and dietary recommendations.
3. **Prescription and Medication Management:** Ensure timely prescription renewals and medication distribution.
4. **Dietary Recommendations:** Track and update patient dietary guidelines.
5. **Emergency Alerts:** Notify healthcare providers about emergencies or missed appointments.
