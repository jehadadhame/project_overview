1. **Core Problem**: Focus on kidney patients’ needs. What essential services are you aiming to provide? Examples might be appointment scheduling, dialysis session management, medication management, and follow-up monitoring.
    
2. **Boundaries**: Exclude things that are out of your project’s immediate scope. For example, managing other chronic diseases or full hospital administration.
    
3. **Context Model**: Your system should interact with key entities like doctors, pharmacies, appointment systems, and patient health records. Think about all the touchpoints and limit the scope to just those directly impacting the patient experience.



## question to ask ? :

- **Patient Needs:**  
    “What are the essential needs of kidney patients that we should prioritize in this system?”  
    This will help you narrow the project’s focus to specific pain points.
    
- **Doctor’s Role:**  
    “What functionalities would you, as doctors, need from this system to effectively monitor and treat patients?”  
    This identifies the features doctors expect for patient care.
    
- **Boundaries:**  
    “Are there any features or areas we should avoid or leave out to keep the project manageable?”  
    This helps define what _not_ to include.
    
- **Collaboration and Feedback:**  
    “How can we work with you to ensure the system meets patient care needs while staying aligned with university expectations?”  
    This opens the door for ongoing input and guidance.
    
- **Success Criteria:**  
    “What would you consider a successful outcome for this project? How will we know we’ve met our goals?”  
    This will define how to measure the project’s success.
